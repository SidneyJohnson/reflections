When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When you need to collaborate with more than one person, or when you want multiple back-ups of the information.  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  In case there are changes made to the project that you do not wish to have in your code, like if a team member submitted broken code.
